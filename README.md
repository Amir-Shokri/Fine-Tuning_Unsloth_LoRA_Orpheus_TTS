# Fine-Tuning Orpheus TTS with Unsloth and LoRA 

---
<div align="left">

# Summary 

<p align="justify"> The project provides code and notebooks for adapting Orpheus TTS via LoRA using the Unsloth framework. It demonstrates how to fine-tune a large speech model (Orpheus, built on LLaMA backbone) with low-rank parameter updates (LoRA) rather than full model tuning. The repository includes scripts, example datasets, and output voice samples to guide users through training and inference. It leverages Unsloth’s memory-efficient training techniques, which enable faster fine-tuning with reduced VRAM usage. The aim is to allow expressive voice cloning, style adaptation, and emotion control in text-to-speech systems with manageable compute resources.
